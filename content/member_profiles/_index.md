Biodiversity measurement and forecasting, especially Shannon-Information/Entropy measures for genes and species.  Shannon measures form part of a profile of measures, whose other two main parts are richness and Simpson/Heterozygosity; using all three parts often gives the most informative result.

I am an applied mathematical modeller of ecological and biological systems, with a strong interest in using these models to inform conservation decisions. My work aims to bridge the gaps between ecologists, modellers and decision-makers, and show how mathematics can be used to gain substantial insights into ecosystem functioning as well as inform the management of ecosystems.

I am a biological oceanographer, with an interest in how oceanographic processes structure pelagic ecosystems (planktonic and fisheries) at regional and global scales. My work reveals how zooplankton processes regulate fisheries production, carbon export, and improve our ability to model and manage marine ecosystems.
